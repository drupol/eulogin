# pCAS library
[![Build Status](https://drone.fpfis.eu/api/badges/openeuropa/pcas/status.svg)](https://drone.fpfis.eu/openeuropa/pcas/)

pCAS, a CAS library for PHP.

## Installation

```bash
composer require openeuropa/pcas
```

## Usage

In order to use the pCAS library you need a session object that implements
[Symfony's `SessionInterface`](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/sessions.html).

You can pass that object to the pCAS factory class as shown below:

```php
<?php

use OpenEuropa\pcas\PCasFactory;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\Session;

$factory = new PCasFactory(new Session());
```

You can access a fully functional pCAS library as shown below:

```php
<?php

$pcas = $factory->getPCas();
```

The pCAS factory object also accepts the following configuration parameters:

| Parameter  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `base_url` | The CAS service base URL. It defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` |
| `protocol` | The CAS protocol specification. It defaults to [this list](./Resources/config/p_cas.yml) |

You can set those parameters as shown below:

```php
<?php

use OpenEuropa\pcas\PCasFactory;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Session\Session;

$factory = new PCasFactory(new Session(), [
    'base_url' => 'http://my-cas-server.com',
    'protocol' => [...],
]);
$pcas = $factory->getPCas();
```

Both parameters are optional, although you'll surely want to set `base_url` to a different value.

## Demo

The pCAS library is bundled with two independent Symfony app:

* demo-client: A basic web app that can authenticate to a CAS server to access specific pages.
* demo-server: A basic CAS server.

In order to test pCAS library, you must run the server:

```
cd demo-server
composer install
php bin/console server:run 127.0.0.1:8001
```

Then run the web app:

```
cd demo-client
composer install
php bin/console server:run 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Then go on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

You can also test it against ECAS, the authentication service from European Commission by updating the file ```.env``` in
```demo-client``` directory. If this file doesn't exists, you can create it from ```.env.dist```.

The file must contains:

```
APP_ENV=ec
```

## Run the tests

```bash
composer install
./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```
